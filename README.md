Objectives of this project: 

- Build a simple Bloom filter in Python, Scala and Java.
- Built (or select) an appropriate hash function 
- Understand how bit vectors are designed.
- Design different data stores and iterate through using the bloom filter, much like how LSM-Tables use bloom filters for fast access to SSTables.
